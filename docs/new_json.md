#JSON Data format

Case information have been provided by Face2Gene in several incompatible jSON formats.

This file will describe the most recent revision of the jSON provided by Face2Gene as of February 2018.

Beware that the entire information of a single case is now split in the original case information and separately stored mutation information (only filename reference to this data type).
