General structure
=================

The goal of the pipeline is to prepare cases obtained from Face2Gene containing
information on genomic variants, phenotypic features and scores inferred from
the features and a provided photograph with additional data sources, such as an
alternative interpretation of phenotypic features with Phenomizer and the
parsing and conversion of variant HGVS strings into VCF files.

This process requires the following steps:

    * Downloading of Face2Gene cases

    * Parsing of json format cases into internal representation

    * Adding phenomizer data

    * Creating VCF files from HGVS information

    * Checking whether data quality requirements are met*

* for performance and parser implementation reasons an initial check is already
  done on json level


Downloading
===========

Data is acquired from a AWS S3 Bucket, which is updated periodically with new
cases and recalculations of old cases.

JSON Parsing
============

The raw json files provided by Face2Gene are processed into an internal case
representation which attempts to bundle information from various JSON fields
into a simpler structure.


Phenomization
=============

Phenomizer information is included into cases by calling the phenomizer object.


VCF Generation
==============

VCF files are generated by caling the vcf function of the case.


Quality Check functions
=======================

Whether certain criteria have been met for the cases can be checked by using the
check function available in the json object and the case object.


Error correction overrides
==========================


There are multiple possibilities to provide corrections for erroneous input
data.
