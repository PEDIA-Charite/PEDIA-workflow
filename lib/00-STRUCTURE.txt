# Library structure

. base folder

This directory contains utility functions which are used in other functions. If some function is to be used in multiple scripts/classes/steps of the pipeline, it should probably be put here.

api folder

Contains any connectors to external apis, such as entrez, mutalyzer or the phenomizer.

model folder

Contains classes containing models for the file structures we are working with. This includes variant information, case information and additional information gathered through additional processing.
Any object containing information that is being mutated in the pipeline process should probably be here.
